Documentation for the pip accelerator API
=========================================

On this page you can find the complete API documentation of pip-accel
|release|.

A note about backwards compatibility
------------------------------------

Please note that pip-accel has not yet reached a 1.0 version and until that
time arbitrary changes to the API can be made. To clarify that statement:

- On the one hand I value API stability and I've built a dozen tools on top of
  pip-accel myself so I don't think too lightly about breaking backwards
  compatibility :-)

- On the other hand if I see opportunities to simplify the code base or make
  things more robust I will go ahead and do it. Furthermore the implementation
  of pip-accel is dictated (to a certain extent) by pip and this certainly
  influences the API. For example API changes may be necessary to facilitate
  the upgrade to pip 1.5.x (the current version of pip-accel is based on pip
  1.4.x).

In pip-accel 0.16 a completely new API was introduced and support for the old
"API" was dropped. The goal of the new API is to last for quite a while but of
course only time will tell if that plan is going to work out :-)
